What basically happens is that <br>you add another class to your existing set of skills and spells and<br>restart at level 1. A player can now 'go around' the whole game several times. But, this will get harder each <br>time. If you choose to change races while remorting you will be that race<br>FOREVER, please be sure you want to change races.<br><br>There are many features to multiclass playing, but, the main ones <br>of note are:<br><br>* Most of your existing skills/spells are reset to 1%, when you reach<br>  the correct level, you can practice them again. In the meantime, you<br>  gain and practice skills/spells in the new class. Race skills are lost<br>  at remort regardless of class, and 100% in a skill stays at 100%. <br>* Gold, trivia points, quest points, gamestats ect. are kept.<br>* Quest items can be kept they are reset to your level.<br>* You can access the class channels for all the classes you have.<br>* Remorted chars will retain access to hero channel.<br>* Online time will remain untouched. <br>* Different high power skills are available to the number of times<br>  you have remorted.<br>* Remort chars receive bonuses to level restrictions on eq each remort.<br>* Remorts retain hero+ status thus feel less hunger/thirst.<br>* Second time round, exp per level is 2k, third time 3k and so on.<br>  You also 'begin' with many extra training and practice sessions.<br>* You get the lowest level of a skill/spell if two or more of your <br>  classes have that spell.<br>* When leveling you will get the highest gain of all classes.<br>* The same also applies to AC, you get the best Thac0 for each class.<br>* When increasing stats, you will get the primary stat (+2) bonus of<br>  all your classes. If you have two classes with the same primary <br>  stat, the bonus is only given once.<br>* When you gain a skill, if you have two classes with that skill and<br>  there are different CP costs, you will pay the lower.<br>* 'Who' and 'Group' will show a 1 letter abbreviation for your class<br>  and the total number of classes you have. 'whois' will show<br>  all of your classes.<br><br>To remort follow the following steps:<br><br>1. Make sure you're a HERO (Level 150 ).<br><br>2. Remove any eq and either donate/sac/auction it all or put some in a locker.<br><br>3. Go to the Healer in Midgaard (1 n from recall), type 'remort'<br>   and follow instructions, you will be re-guided through the ceration process.<br>   <br>Please take a few seconds to read very carefully the messages that the mud<br>gives you during the remort process.
